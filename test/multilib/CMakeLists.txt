# NEEDED path to this library within the executable is still set as if the compiled exectubale
# was located in the default target. e.g. CMAKE_BINARY_DIR/test/<executable>/
# Example:
# - Wrong relative path: "../../bin/lib/libtest_lib.so => not found"
# - Should have been: "./lib/libtest_lib.so"

# CMake: IMPORTED_NO_SONAME: Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no "soname".
# Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has no "soname" field.
# CMake may adjust generated link commands for some platforms to prevent the linker
# from using the path to the library in place of its missing soname. Ignored for non-imported targets.
