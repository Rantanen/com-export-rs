/// object implements support detailed error info. When a COM client
/// receives an error-HRESULT, it may query for error info support through
/// this interface. If the interface returns an `S_OK` as opposed to
/// `S_FALSE` return value, the client can then use separate error info
/// APIs to retrieve a detailed `IErrorInfo` object that contains more
/// details about the error, such as the error message.
///
/// Intercom COM classes support the detailed error info for all user
/// specified interfaces automatically. Only methods that return a
/// two-parameter `Result<S,E>` value will store the detailed `IErrorInfo`.
/// Other methods will set a null `IErrorInfo` value.
